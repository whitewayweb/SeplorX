# Channels Integration

## Purpose

Channels are e-commerce order sources — storefronts from which orders are pulled into SeplorX. Users connect a WooCommerce store, Shopify store, Amazon account, etc., and orders sync automatically.

Channels are **distinct from Apps**:

| | Apps | Channels |
|---|---|---|
| Examples | Delhivery, FedEx, Razorpay | WooCommerce, Shopify, Amazon |
| Purpose | Shipping / payment providers | Order source integrations |
| Instances per type | 1 per user (unique constraint) | Many per user (multi-store) |
| Auth method | API keys / passwords (config fields) | OAuth (1-click authorization) |
| DB table | `app_installations` | `channels` |
| Row created | On "Install" click | Before OAuth redirect (`pending`) |
| Config storage | `config` JSONB (dynamic fields) | `credentials` JSONB (fixed keys) |

## Registry Pattern

Channel type definitions live in TypeScript. The database stores instances only.

```
Channel Registry (TypeScript)    → defines available channel types
channels table (PostgreSQL)      → one row per connected channel instance
```

### Adding a New Channel Type

Add one object to `src/lib/channels/registry.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: "shopify",               // unique slug, matches channelType in DB
  name: "Shopify",
  description: "Connect your Shopify storefront to manage orders.",
  icon: "/channels/shopify.svg", // null to use placeholder icon
  authType: "oauth",           // "oauth" | "apikey"
  popular: true,               // shows in "Popular Channels" section
  available: true,             // false = "Coming soon" overlay in UI
}
```

Place the channel icon SVG at `public/channels/{id}.svg`.

No database migration is needed to add a new channel type. The `channelType` column is `varchar` — it holds whatever string the registry defines.

## Type Definitions (`src/lib/channels/types.ts`)

```typescript
type ChannelType = "woocommerce" | "shopify" | "amazon" | "custom";

interface ChannelDefinition {
  id: ChannelType;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string | null;       // path under /public/channels/, or null
  authType: "oauth" | "apikey";
  popular: boolean;
  available: boolean;        // gates UI access
}

type ChannelStatus = "pending" | "connected" | "disconnected";

interface ChannelInstance {
  id: number;
  channelType: string;
  name: string;              // user-defined (e.g. "hiyaautomotive.com")
  status: ChannelStatus;
  storeUrl: string | null;
  defaultPickupLocation: string | null;
  createdAt: Date | null;
}
```

## WooCommerce OAuth Flow (1-Click Integration)

WooCommerce has a built-in REST API key creation endpoint that drives the 1-click flow.

### Step-by-step

```
1. User completes wizard (name, pickup location, store URL)
2. Client calls createChannel server action
   → INSERT channels row with status="pending"
   → Returns channelId
3. Client builds WooCommerce authorize URL:
   {storeUrl}/wc-auth/v1/authorize
     ?app_name=SeplorX
     &scope=read_write
     &user_id={channelId}          ← our internal row ID (WooCommerce echoes it back)
     &return_url={appUrl}/channels
     &callback_url={appUrl}/api/channels/woocommerce/callback
4. window.location.href = authorizeUrl  (browser redirects to WordPress admin)
5. User clicks "Approve" in their WordPress admin
6. WooCommerce POSTs to callback_url with:
     consumer_key, consumer_secret, key_permissions, user_id
7. Callback route (/api/channels/woocommerce/callback):
   → Looks up channels row by user_id (= channelId)
   → encrypt(consumer_key), encrypt(consumer_secret)
   → UPDATE channels SET status="connected", credentials={...}
   → Redirects 302 to /channels?connected=1
8. User sees channel in list with "Connected" badge
```

### Callback route

`src/app/api/channels/woocommerce/callback/route.ts` — public `POST` handler.

WooCommerce sends `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (not JSON). The handler reads `request.formData()`. Credentials are encrypted with `encrypt()` from `src/lib/crypto.ts` before being written to the `credentials` JSONB column.

The `user_id` parameter in the WooCommerce OAuth URL is a passthrough field — WooCommerce echoes it back unchanged in the callback body. We use it as our internal `channelId` to match the callback to the correct pending row.

### Local development

The callback URL must be publicly reachable by the WooCommerce server. In local development:

1. Run `ngrok http 3000` → get a URL like `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app` in `.env.local`
3. The WooCommerce callback URL becomes: `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/channels/woocommerce/callback`

**Simpler alternative (no WordPress needed):** Simulate the callback with curl after the wizard creates the pending row:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/channels/woocommerce/callback \
  -d "user_id=CHANNEL_ID&consumer_key=ck_test123&consumer_secret=cs_test456"
```

This tests the full encrypt + store + redirect flow.

## Add Channel Wizard (`src/components/channels/add-channel-wizard.tsx`)

A single Dialog with local `step` state (1–4). No URL routing per step.

| Step | Content |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Select channel type — grid of `ChannelDefinition` cards; unavailable ones show "Soon" badge |
| 2 | Channel name — user-defined label (e.g. "hiyaautomotive.com") |
| 3 | Default preference — default pickup location for orders from this channel |
| 4 | Connect — channel-specific OAuth/API config (WooCommerce: store URL + "Integrate in 1-Click") |

Step 4 calls `createChannel` server action, receives the new `channelId`, then redirects the browser to the WooCommerce authorize URL. The wizard does not poll or wait — the OAuth callback redirects back to `/channels` when complete.

## Server Actions (`src/app/channels/actions.ts`)

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `createChannel` | INSERT channels row (status: pending), returns `{ channelId }` |
| `disconnectChannel` | UPDATE status="disconnected", wipes credentials JSONB |
| `deleteChannel` | DELETE the row entirely |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Base URL for building callback_url and return_url in OAuth flow. Set to `http://localhost:3000` locally, production domain on Vercel. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex string (32 bytes) for AES-256-GCM encryption of OAuth credentials. Same key used by Apps. |

## Current Channel Types

| ID | Name | Auth | Available |
|----|------|------|-----------|
| woocommerce | WooCommerce | OAuth (1-click) | ✅ |
| shopify | Shopify | OAuth | 🚧 Coming soon |
| amazon | Amazon | API key | 🚧 Coming soon |
| custom | Custom | API key | 🚧 Coming soon |
